We all use soap in our daily lives. According to Wikipedia, _"Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products."_ While using soap, I noticed an interesting phenomenon: **a new bar of soap seems to dissolve at much faster rate initially, but as it gets smaller, the rate of dissolution slows down**.

At first, this felt like a trivial observation—something we experience daily but never question. Curious, I shared this with a friend (his name is Suyog and he is an Aerospace Engineer), stating _Soap dissolves exponentially_. Instead of brushing it off, he approached it like an Engineer (or physicist–mathematician) would. His exact reply was: _"Interesting!😃"_. What followed was a simple yet elegant mathematical explanation that captured this everyday phenomenon well.

I have tried to share our story through this article.

## Modeling the Soap

To translate the observation into mathematics, we made a few simplifying assumptions:

- The soap is assumed to be a **perfect cube**.
    
- The soap dissolves uniformly from all exposed surfaces.
    
- The **rate of change of volume** is proportional to the **total surface area** of the soap.
    

Let the side length of the soap cube be $x$ units.

## Geometric Relations

The volume of a cube is given by

$$  
V = x^3  
$$

The total surface area of the cube is

$$  
A = 6x^2  
$$

## Dissolution Rate Equation

Assuming that the rate at which the soap volume decreases is directly proportional to its surface area:

$$  
\frac{dV}{dt} = -k A  
$$

where:

- $k$ is the **dissolution constant**, and
    
- the negative sign indicates a decrease in volume over time.
    

Substituting $A = 6x^2$ and $V = x^3$, we write

$$  
\frac{dV}{dt} = -6k x^2  
$$

Since

$$  
V = x^3 \Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dt} = 3x^2 \frac{dx}{dt}  
$$

we obtain

$$  
3x^2 \frac{dx}{dt} = -6k x^2  
$$

Canceling $x^2$ from both sides gives

$$  
\frac{dx}{dt} = -2k  
$$

## Solving the Equation

Integrating with respect to time:

$$  
\int dx = -2k \int dt  
$$

which yields

$$  
x = -2kt + C  
$$

At time $t = 0$, let the initial volume of the soap be $V_0$. Then the initial side length is

$$  
x_0 = V_0^{1/3}  
$$

Substituting into the equation, we get

$$  
x = V_0^{1/3} - 2kt  
$$

---

## Final Expression for Soap Volume

Since $V = x^3$, the volume of the soap at any time $t$ is

$$  
\boxed{V(t) = \left(V_0^{1/3} - 2kt\right)^3}  \tag{1}
$$

This equation neatly explains the original observation:

- When the soap is **large**, its surface area is high, so it dissolves quickly.
    
- As the soap becomes **smaller**, the surface area reduces, slowing down the dissolution rate.
    
- The existence of a real root for this equation indicates a finite time at which the soap vanishes completely—confirming the physical validity of the model.

Assuming $V_0=1$ and $k=0.05$, plot of equation $(1)$ looks like:

## About the Dissolution Constant

The parameter (k) is the **dissolution constant** of the soap. It depends on several real-world factors, including:

- Soap composition
    
- Water temperature
    
- Water hardness
    
- Degree of agitation
    

The unit of $k$ is ($\text{m/s}$).

## Closing Thoughts

What started as a casual observation during a routine activity turned into a satisfying example of how **simple mathematics can explain everyday phenomena**. It also reinforced an important lesson: even the most mundane experiences can lead to meaningful insights when viewed through a scientific lens.

Sometimes, all it takes is curiosity—and a friend willing to turn that curiosity into equations.
