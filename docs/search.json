    "text": "GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) is one of the prestigious exams conducted in India. GATE offers a gateway for Indian engineering undergraduates for higher education and better job opportunities.\nBack when I was still an undergrad student, I didn’t plan to pursue masters. Somehow, I decided to pursue Masters while I was working in SMS Group Pune Office and that’s when decided to appear for the GATE 2025.  \nAfter my decision, I consulted one of my good friends (dude’s an aerospace engineer and works with satellites and stuffs) who has already appeared for the exam. I took his suggestion and then I planned my studies. I planned my subjects, starting with easy ones because I needed to form a habit of studying. Having a realistic plan is a first step. But having a plan is not enough; one must dedicate to follow the plan.\nThe difficulty was, I had a day time job and I had to manage GATE preparation with it. As I progressed, I managed to balance both of these. That’s when I learnt how to balance work with goals.  \nAt start, I used to drift and get distracted from my studies. But with patience, consistency (being persistent) and perseverance, I managed to form a daily routine where I could spend 3 hours a day for the preparation.\nWe may need to set clear boundaries and learn to say NO considering we have a family or friend who would like to meet us or they may have some plans. But those are the sacrifices that one must be willing to take. Friends and family are there to support. But one should be ready to face the fact that we may not receive the support which we want from friends and family all the time.  \nOne of the biggest mistakes in my planning was, I didn’t take uncertainty into account. There were certain things beyond my control (such as getting sick, disasters, zombie apocalypse, etc.). It is unlikely to avoid such unexpected events, but one must take those into account while planning.\nWe expect to be perfect in our execution but in the end, we are mere humans. It’s a natural tendency to fail or loose a track. It’s a part of the process and as long as we get back on track, then there are no worries.  \nAlso, I used to focus only on my studies only. Dedicating on one specific task or goal. I avoided doing anything apart from studies. But when I was nominated for office cricked tournament against my will, I was distresses because I have been avoiding tasks that would distract me from my studies. Again, with time, I was able to manage my studies with cricket practices. For the first time in my life, I was able to manage my studies with extra-curricular activities.  \nAs exam date was approaching, I have realized some mistakes that I could have avoided. They are listed below\n\n Cyclic revision was not followed\n Test series started late\n PYQ solved but important questions were not collected\n Test series was not properly analyzed\n Neglecting aptitude; Couldn’t follow parallel study of mathematics.\n Not preparing cheat sheets or micro notes.\n Delaying planned activities or topics. Accumulated many tasks for later\n Didn’t take Parkinson’s law into account\n Did not measure time spent on studying\n\nThen, I realized how I should have studied from the start. Like using:\n\nPomodoro technique\nActive recall and spaced repetition\nFrequently testing\n\nOn 2nd Feb 2025, I appeared for the exam and then, I didn’t know what to do. Although I had planned certain tasks to do after my GATE Exam, I have failed to do them. Also, I was focused on appearing for GATE 2025. Once it was achieved, I stopped studying, revising, planning, etc. Thus, I lost my momentum. As stated in Atomic Habits by James Clear, one must make a system and not a goal. I have realized that I should I made a system for preparing for competitive exam. I got lazy and lost my commitment. This is explained by James Clear in one of his articles Zanshin.\nTo summarize, GATE taught me following things,\n\n Importance of having a plan and executing it\n Perseverance, Practice, Patience, Persistence (Consistency)\n Setting up boundaries (Learning to say NO), sacrificing for the good\n Getting back up repeatedly despite falling down"

    "text": "Engineering is one of humanity’s greatest assets. From landing on Mars to exploring the Mariana Trench, none of it would be possible without the mind of engineers. While scientists try to understand why the world behaves a certain way, engineers use those principles to solve real problems, and that journey isn’t always pleasant.\nIn fact, whatever you think might go wrong usually goes wrong. Yet when engineering action works, it gives a great sense of joy.\nThe process starts with a simple proof of concept, just to note what works and what fails. Through countless iterations, trial and error, and messy experiments, engineers reach closer to a solution. Failure isn’t just expected; it’s a natural and important part of the process. As Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”\nInstead of tackling a problem all at once, engineers break it into manageable steps, ask hard questions, think critically, and stay curious. When something breaks—and it will—they reflect on why. After failing repeatedly, anyone might feel stupid. But there’s nothing wrong with that feeling. It simply means you are learning. In the end, resilience is what makes repeated failures into success. And that transformation is what makes engineering so deeply rewarding.\nAnd the best part is, you don’t need a college degree to become an engineer. If you’re curious enough, ask hard questions, and learn specific set of skills which you can apply to solve set of problems, you’re already thinking like an engineer. As George Bernard Shaw put it, “Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” With curiosity, resilience, and a little bit of luck, you can create yourself into an engineer."

According to Wikipedia, “Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products.” While using soap, I noticed an interesting phenomenon: a new bar of soap seems to dissolve at much faster rate initially, but as it gets smaller, the rate of dissolution slows down.\nAt first, this felt like a trivial observation—something we experience daily but never question. Curious, I shared this with a friend (his name is Suyog and he is an Aerospace Engineer), stating Soap dissolves exponentially. Instead of brushing it off, he approached it like an Engineer (or physicist–mathematician) would. His exact reply was: “Interesting!😃”. What followed was a simple yet elegant mathematical explanation that captured this everyday phenomenon well.\nI have tried to share our story through this article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Back in 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown, I stumbled upon Google’s Grasshopper app. It was designed to teach JavaScript through small, interactive challenges. I was curious, so I tried it — and within the first few lessons I felt completely lost. Nothing made sense, and I quickly gave up.\nBut after a few weeks, something inside me pushed me to try again. This time, while doing the Grasshopper lessons, I also watched a YouTube video showcasing cool things people were building with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And suddenly… something clicked. For the first time, JavaScript didn’t feel like a foreign language. I finished the entire Grasshopper course.\nWhen I wrote my very first HTML file, I simply pasted the JavaScript code into HTML file — and of course, nothing happened. I didn’t even know the basics of HTML! I almost gave up again. Then a friend (who works in a reputed IT company) introduced me to fundamental HTML tags. That tiny explanation opened a huge door. My first ever working JavaScript program was, alert(\"Hello World\"). Seeing that alert pop up on the screen felt magical. It was a small program, but to me, it meant I made the computer do something\nAt that point, my learning truly began and I picked up CSS, learned how HTML pages actually work, and slowly started combining everything. My first project was a simple form (check out here) — just HTML and CSS — created to understand tags and layout. After that came a Mental Math Tool (check out here), where I finally used all three: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (I even updated it recently!).\nIn Google’s Grasshopper app, there were two modules on animations using D3.js; which I found bit difficult to understand. So I explored animations using HTML canvas. My first ever project for animation was simulating Solar System with Sun, Moon and the Earth. Seeing those celestial bodies orbit on screen was incredibly satisfying (see it yourself here).\nThese days, I don’t use raw HTML and CSS as much. Instead, I use p5.js to create generative art and fun simulations. It gives me the freedom to turn ideas into visuals quickly. I often follow tutorials from The Coding Train, which continues to inspire me.\nWhat started as frustration during a global lockdown turned into a passion for coding and creative expression. And the journey is still going on. I have documented the course content from Google Grasshopper app (app is shut down). You can check it out by clicking here."

Introduction\nI completed the course ME60353 – Knowledge Based Systems in Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, taught by Prof. D. K. Pratihar, where I learned about fuzzy set theory. I have implemented fuzzy sets in Python as part of personal mini project.\n\nClassical (Crisp) Set:-\nA classical set is an unordered collection of distinct elements—essentially, a collection of objects.\nExamples: - Set of all positive integers\n- Set of all months in a year\nMathematically, a set can be represented as:\n\\[A = \\{~ a,e,i,o,u ~ \\}\\]\n\n\n\n2. What is a Fuzzy set?\nA fuzzy set is a collection of ordered pairs, where each element is associated with a membership value between 0 and 1.\nMathematically, a fuzzy set is represented as:\n\\[A =\\{ (x,\\mu_{S}(x)), x\\in X\\}\\]\nWhere \\(X\\) is an Universal set and \\(\\mu_{S}\\) is membership function value.\n\n\n3. Fuzzy Operations\nHere, we will look into traditiona fuzzy operations along with respective python implementation.\nLet A and B be tow fuzzy sets defined on universal set X, then different Fuzzy set operations can be defined as follows,\n\nSubset:-\n\n\\[A\\subset B \\iff \\mu_{A}(x)&lt;\\mu_{B}(x)\\]\ndef subset(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns True if a fuzzy set is subset of another.\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(other, FuzzySet):\n        return NotImplemented\n    if self._elements.keys() != other._elements.keys():\n        return False\n    return all(self._elements[k] &lt; other._elements[k] for k in self._elements)\n\nEqual:-\n\n\\[A= B \\iff \\mu_{A}(x)=\\mu_{B}(x)\\]\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns True if two fuzzy sets have exactly the same elements and membership values.\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(other, FuzzySet):\n        return NotImplemented\n    if self._elements.keys() != other._elements.keys():\n        return False\n    return all(self._elements[k] == other._elements[k] for k in self._elements)\n\nComplement:-\n\n\\[\\bar A  = \\{ x, 1-\\mu_{A}(x)\\}\\]\ndef complement(self):\n    \"\"\"Returns the complement of this fuzzy set as a new FuzzySet.\"\"\"\n    result = FuzzySet()\n    for k, v in self._elements.items():\n        result[k] = 1 - v\n    return result\n\nUnion:-\n\n\\[A\\cup B = \\{ x, max[\\mu_{A}(x),\\mu_{B}(x)] \\}\\]\ndef union(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns the union of two fuzzy sets as a new FuzzySet.\"\"\"\n    result = FuzzySet()\n    keys = set(self._elements.keys()) | set(other._elements.keys())\n    for k in keys:\n        m1 = self._elements.get(k, 0)\n        m2 = other._elements.get(k, 0)\n        result[k] = max(m1, m2)\n    return result\n\nIntersection:-\n\n\\[A\\cup B = \\{ x, min[\\mu_{A}(x),\\mu_{B}(x)] \\}\\]\ndef intersection(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns the intersection of two fuzzy sets as a new FuzzySet.\"\"\"\n    result = FuzzySet()\n    keys = set(self._elements.keys()) & set(other._elements.keys())\n    for k in keys:\n        m1 = self._elements[k]\n        m2 = other._elements[k]\n        result[k] = min(m1, m2)\n    return result\n\nAlgebric Product:-\n\n\\[A\\cdot B = \\{ x,\\mu_{A}(x)\\cdot\\mu_{B}(x) \\}\\]\n def __mul__(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns the multiplication of two fuzzy sets (product t-norm)\n    or scalar multiplication with a crisp number.\"\"\"\n    result = FuzzySet()\n    \n    if isinstance(other, FuzzySet):\n        # FuzzySet × FuzzySet\n        keys = set(self._elements.keys()) | set(other._elements.keys())\n        for k in keys:\n            m1 = self._elements.get(k, 0)\n            m2 = other._elements.get(k, 0)\n            result[k] = m1 * m2\n        return result\n    ...\n\nMultiplication by crisp number:-\n\n\\[c\\cdot A = \\{ x, c\\cdot\\mu_{A}(x)\\}\\]\n def __mul__(self, other):\n    \"\"\"Returns the multiplication of two fuzzy sets (product t-norm)\n    or scalar multiplication with a crisp number.\"\"\"\n    result = FuzzySet()\n    ...\n    elif isinstance(other, (int, float)):\n        # FuzzySet × scalar\n        for k, v in self._elements.items():\n            val = v * other\n            result[k] = min(max(val, 0), 1)  # clamp into [0, 1]\n        return result\n\npth power:-\n\n\\[A^p = \\{ x, \\mu_{A}(x)^p\\}\\]\ndef __pow__(self, p):\n    \"\"\"Returns a new FuzzySet with membership values raised to the power p.\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(p, (int, float)):\n        return NotImplemented\n    if p &lt;
